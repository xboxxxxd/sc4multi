Launcher.exe and SC4Multi.dll must be in the same directory in your game's application folder. By default this is:

    C:\Program Files\Maxis\SimCity 4 Deluxe\Apps

SC4Multi will only be guaranteed to work with the Deluxe edition. It is not expected to work with a vanilla installation and Rush Hour. It is guaranteed to fail when using a vanilla installation only.

This code is likely incomplete, and will only show a few messages to make sure the launcher works properly.
